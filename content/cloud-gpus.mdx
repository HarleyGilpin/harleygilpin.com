# Unleashing the Power of AI with Cloud GPUs: A Step-By-Step Guide

Today, we dive into the heart of the exciting realm of AI and machine learning, more specifically, how to run any model of your choice using cloud GPUs, even the gigantic ones like Wakano 65B.

## The Benefits of Using Cloud GPUs

Many of us don't have the luxury of high-end GPUs on our local machines. However, we can circumvent these challenges by renting cloud GPUs by the hour from cloud GPU services. In this guide, we'll be using a service called RunPod.

## Setting Up Your Cloud GPU

After signing up and choosing your GPU on RunPod, you'll need to enter your credit card information and deposit some money into your account. The next step is choosing your GPU and deploying it using a template.

## Running Your Model

From the 'My Pods' screen, you can connect to your GPU and start running your model. Here, you can download and load any model you want, including colossal models like the Guanaco 65 billion parameter GPTQ version.

## Text Generation

Once your model has loaded successfully, navigate to the 'Text Generation' tab. This is where you can experiment with various prompt templates and generate text. Experiment with various settings to find what works best for you.
