        Hello there! I'm Harley, but most people know me as <b>Pixel</b> online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a seasoned full-stack developer from Eugene, Oregon with a versatile professional background. My journey began at Bushnell University, where I majored in Business Management and Administration. From there, I expanded into freelance software development and digital marketing, and for the past 18 months, I've been an RPA Developer at Armanino.

        Over the past 12 years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, including Python, Kotlin, Java, HTML/CSS, React, and Node.js. I am also a certified Microsoft Power Platform professional. My career so far has been marked by a strong focus on precision, efficiency, and innovation, traits that have been instrumental in my role as an RPA developer.

        One of my most notable projects was the importation of the 890 Jump Super Yacht starship from the game Star Citizen into VR Chat, a project that required intricate texturing work and presented numerous lighting challenges. I'm proud to share that it was received positively, garnering reviews from content creators (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@citizenred/video/7111750272782716166"><u>TikTok</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWAfU1_tA9Y"><u>YouTube</u></a>).

        Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an avid gamer and technology enthusiast. I contribute actively to open-source multiplayer game development projects and am passionate about creating innovative and immersive VR experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for my professional goals, I plan on deepening my proficiency with current RPA tools and languages and aim to complete several certifications this year. Long-term, I see myself as a recognized expert in RPA technology, mentoring other developers, and leading high-performing teams.
